### Project Description
The Immobile Object Speed Test is a humorous and satirical web-based experiment that challenges the very concept of motion detection.
This project invites users to test the "speed" of famously unmoving objects — statues, rocks, parked vehicles, or even abstract concepts like boredom.
The core idea is to gamify and parody typical performance tests (like internet speed tests) by applying them to things that are obviously immobile.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today’s fast-paced, hyper-optimized world, we obsess over speed — internet speed, processor speed, delivery speed. 
But amidst this frenzy of motion, one critical question has been utterly ignored by scientists, engineers, and philosophers alike:

“How fast is that statue?”

The global community has long suffered from a complete lack of tools to measure the speed of immobile objects.
Rocks, park benches, ancient ruins — all tragically excluded from the speed testing revolution.
Without a proper system to benchmark their majestic stillness, how can we ever truly appreciate their unwavering commitment to staying put?

This blatant oversight has left statues unranked, rocks unmeasured, and the public woefully uninformed about which inanimate object is the least likely to move.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’ve built a high-tech (but totally fake) testing platform that puts statues, rocks, traffic cones, and 
other proudly motionless objects through rigorous speed tests — complete with loading bars, data charts, and scientific-sounding nonsense

Each test is a celebration of stillness, a salute to the unsung heroes of motionlessness, and a joyful mockery of our obsession with speed.

Because if everything else is getting measured… why not measure the unmeasurable?

Opening Interface:

The UI has a clean, futuristic design with a bold title and possibly a dropdown or button prompting the user to begin the test.

The fonts and layout suggest a parody of technical tools like internet speed tests.

Initiating the Test:

The user clicks a button (likely labeled “Start Test” or something absurd like “Begin Inertia Analysis”).

An animation or fake loading bar appears, simulating an intense measurement process on an object that is clearly doing nothing.

Displaying the Results:

The app generates mock results with overly specific but completely meaningless statistics such as:

Speed: 0.000000 m/s

Motion Resistance: ∞

Stillness Index: Maximum

May include graphs or charts powered by a library like Chart.js or Recharts, adding to the satirical tone.

Visual Gags and UI Flair:

Subtle animations (possibly using Framer Motion) add fake “scientific” flair.

The interface treats the whole experience with undeserved seriousness — which is exactly the joke.
